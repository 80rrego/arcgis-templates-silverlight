## Instructions (for the Silverlight 5 platform)

1. Fork and then clone the repo or download the .zip file.
2. Setup your Visual Studio or Blend development environment to support Silverlight 5 development. See the [System Requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/silverlight/guide/system-requirements.htm) for the ArcGIS API for Silverlight as a guide. All templates require the Blend SDK for Silverlight 5 which is only included with Blend for Visual Studio 2012(SP2+) or 2013.
3. Download the [ArcGIS API for Silverlight](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/downloads/) (requires ArcGIS Developer account).
4. Download and install the latest version of the [Silverlight 5 Toolkit on CodePlex]((http://silverlight.codeplex.com/).
5. C# and VB.NET solutions are available for each template. In Visual Studio or Blend, open the solution of your choice. If necessary repair the references to the ArcGIS API for Silverlight assemblies, System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit assembly (Silverlight 5 Toolkit), and System.Windows.Interactivity (Blend SDK for Silverlight 5) assembly in the Silverlight application.
6. Clean, build, customize, enjoy.
